# This script is to help when developing or packaging the template.

# Ash Gittins <ash@ajg.net.au>
#
# The template file has to have the full path to the state directories in it when
# Ardour loads it. This is a problem if you are moving the template to another
# machine (or user account). Ardour has a packaged template format (the templates
# folder is simply tar'd up with xz compression (-J) and any instance of the full
# path in template-dir="" is replaced with "$TEMPLATEDIR", so this script can
# build a template archive for easy distribution, which the user can then simply
# import into Ardour through "Window", "Template Manager", "Import".
#
# This script is tested on Linux, but *should* work on MacOS as well.
